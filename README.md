# UTA Fullstack Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage as part of the prework for a fullstack developer bootcamp. It's meant to be a quick reference and study guide for my notes on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as basic commands for using the Git command line.
I built it for the experience of making a simple website from scratch, and it was a great refresher for the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It was expecially nice to learn how to properly use Git Bash, as I've primarily used GUI based Git programs, and I didn't know the commands or what order to use them, to create and commit branches.
This webpage will work great as a quick reference if I'm blanking on how something works, or if I can't remember a Git command.

## Installation

## Usage

A way to quickly reference notes on basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript functionality, and the basic Git commands for Git Bash. Use it if you're blanking on something, and cant remember what its called, or how it works!
If you want a suggestion on what to study, the Chrome Devtools console will have a randomly selected topic for you to study!
